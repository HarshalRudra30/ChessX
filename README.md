## About:
ChessX is a chess engine consisting of 2 models. Model_1 is available to play 
<a href="https://chesx.netlify.app/">here</a>



## Models:
**Model-1:** This model uses *Alpha Beta Pruning* technique to analyze the game and generate a move that it regards as strongest. The search depth of this model can be altered from 1-3.

**Model-2:** This model uses two algorithms *Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)* and *Minimax Algorithm*. When generating a move, it judges the effectiveness values outputted by the different algorithms and finds which algorithm has the highest effectiveness value.
